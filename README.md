Irrigation is a critical part of agriculture, but conventional methods often lead to water waste, especially in areas where water is scarce. 
Our smart irrigation system addresses this issue by using sensors, microcontrollers, 
and data analytics to monitor real-time soil conditions and control water flow precisely when and where it's needed.

Software Requriments : Python, Arduino IDE
Hardware requriments: Aruino UNO bord, Soil Moisture Sensors
